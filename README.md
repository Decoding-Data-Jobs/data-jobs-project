## Overview



##### We downloaded the data from Kaggle as a .csv

1. Decide how to clean / prep the data.

2. Text Preprocessing

## **Project Goal**

<<<<<<< HEAD
**Goal Text Here**
=======
Our main goal of the project is to deliver a dashboard to show skill sets that are in demand. We will be using machine learning models to validate that the analysis conducted is sound and accurate.

=======
- NLP: To find commonalities in posts.

- Classification: To predict the location, job type, etc. based on other features

- Regression: To predict pay based on location/skills

- Dashboard: Possibly include drop down boxes for skill/locations/job titles to demonstrate full stack data science capabilities

## Acquire

Data originated from Google Jobs “Data Analyst” postings. While we built a web scraper to pull the data ourselves, this Kaggle Dataset already has a year's worth of data and is adding 100~ daily by automation.

Google's Terms of Service explicitly disallow scraping of its services without permission. Scraping can lead to legal consequences. Although Google does not take legal action against scraping, it uses a range of defensive methods that makes scraping their results a challenging task, even when the scraping tool is realistically spoofing a normal web browser.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Offending IPs and offending IP networks can easily be stored in a blacklist database to detect offenders much faster. Using a proxy or VPN is necessary for anything outside of human-like.

We managed to very slowly scrape several hundred job postings using Selenium, but in order to perform accurate large scale analysis, we'd need much more time, or a much larger dataset.

#### *Kaggle Dataset*

While it was undesirable to use a public dataset for analysis, I was able to find a Kaggle dataset that has been updating daily for the past year. The dataset is currently around 150MB and 33,000 different job postings from around the United States.
