## **Acquire**

#### *Rate Limits & Ethics*

[**Google's Robots.txt**](google.com/robots.txt)

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /search

```

Google's Terms of Service explicitly disallow scraping of its services without permission. Scraping can lead to legal consequences. Although Google does not take legal action against scraping, it uses a range of defensive methods that makes scraping their results a challenging task, even when the scraping tool is realistically spoofing a normal web browser.

Offending IPs and offending IP networks can easily be stored in a blacklist database to detect offenders much faster. Using a proxy or VPN is necessary for anything outside of human-like.

We managed to very slowly scrape several hundred job postings using Selenium, but in order to perform accurate large scale analysis, we'd need much more time, or a much larger dataset.

#### *Kaggle Dataset*

While it was undesirable to use a public dataset for analysis, I was able to find a Kaggle dataset that has been updating daily for the past year. The dataset is currently around 150MB and 33,000 different job postings from around the United States.
