<h2 style="font-size:27px; text-align:center;">We developed this dynamic tool that empowers aspiring data analysts to navigate the job market with precision and confidence.</h2>

<h2 style="font-size:20px; text-align:center;">Our project uses 33,000 job postings that were scraped from Google and then processed with machine learning models to validate the results. We're not just sifting through text; we're decoding the jargon of job descriptions to help future data analysts on the hunt for their dream roles. We provide them with a competitive edge by revealing the skills, qualifications, and trends that matter most.</h2>
