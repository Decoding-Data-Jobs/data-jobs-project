    "##### - For Modeling:\n",
    "- Given the class imbalance, we used the precision metric and GridSearch to use the TF-IDF and Logistic Regression models\n",
    "    - ......\n",
    "\n",
    "##### - For Data Collection:\n",
    "- Decided to use the 'Full-Time' positions only to deal with outliers.\n",
    "- Trying to categorize by 'sector' proved to be too inaccurate from the nature of the descriptions in the job posts.\n",
    "- Dataset had very little job positions for engineer/scientists\n",
    "    - Propose including more engineer/scientist positions in the future datasets\n",
    "- 'Location' in the dataset was primarily from the \"Midwest\" and did not include positions from the entire U.S. as we were hoping.\n",
    "    - Propose webscraping separately than the sampleset we acquired to include more locations\n",
    "- Found that there is more jobs posted in the months of Dec-Jan for the past 2 years.\n",
    "- We were able to distiguish skills per analyst/engineer/scientist accurately\n",
    "- 'Salary' was only present in 18% of the data\n",
    "    - Propose trying to include more salary position info in the future.\n",
    "    - Known issue in the industry\n",
