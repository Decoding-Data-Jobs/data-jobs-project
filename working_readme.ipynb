    "**We developed a dynamic tool that empowers aspiring data analysts to navigate the job market with precision and confidence.**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Our project uses 33,000 job postings that were scraped from Google and then processed with machine learning models to validate the results. We're not just sifting through text; we're decoding the jargon of job descriptions to help future data analysts on the hunt for their dream roles. We provide them with a competitive edge by revealing the skills, qualifications, and trends that matter most.* \n",

    "\n",
    "- Data scientists and engineers have a more technical skillset compared to analysts\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data scientists and engineers typically make more than analysts\n",
    "\n",

    "## **Acquire**\n",
    "\n",
    "We originally intended on pulling all of the data myself using LinkedIn webscraping or another job resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "We were able to use a scraper for LinkedIn, but after reading into it, they don't like that and have been known to send cease and desist letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Getting our dataset from Google Jobs**\n",
    "\n",
    "For decent analysis, we would need a fairly large dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "With most job postings not including pay information, this would increase the demand for a large dataset even more.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Use their API**\n",
    "\n",
    "- You'll need an API key from their [dev website](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview)\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can get 100 search queries per day for free.\n",
    "\n",
    "- At a cost of $5 per 1,000, you can get up to 10,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The downside to using their API, people often complain that their API results, aren't true to what searches are actually returning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We also was not able to see if people could use the API for job posting searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Scrape the normal result pages**\n",
    "\n",
    "- While Google does not officially allow it, scraping the search engine results page (SERP) is also an option\n",
    "\n",
    "- Google seems to have very sophisticated technology when it comes to scraping their pages\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you scrape at a rate higher than 8 keyword requests per hour you risk detection\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you push it higher than 10 per hour, this will oftentimes get you blocked\n",
    "\n",
    "- By using multiple IPs you can up the rate (100 IPs = 1,000 requests)\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is also an [open source search engine scraper](http://scraping.compunect.com) written in PHP, that can manage proxies and other detection avoidance methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Use a Scraping Service**\n",
    "\n",
    "- There seem to be many services that offer to do the webscraping\n",
    "\n",
    "- The one that the Kaggle dataset used to scrape was SerpAPI\n",
    "\n",
    "- Their cost was as low as $50 for 5,000 searches per month or as high as $250 for 30,000 searches a month\n",

    "## **Conclusions**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "##### - Modeling Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- We down-sampled our dataset in order to demonstrate an accurate model\n",
    "    - Another option, with more time, would be to collect more Data Scientist and Engineer positions\n",
    "    - Data Analyst, will always have more representation than the other two, just due to more Analyst positions<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Our model is currently only being used to prove that our analysis of the data job skills are different between the three `titles`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Further data validation could be performed by including trigrams and quadgrams, but very computationally expensive\n",
    "\n",
    "##### - Data Collection Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decided to use the 'Full-Time' positions only to deal with outliers\n",
    "    - Freelance jobs will often pay much more, but don't guarantee employment or have benefits\n",
    "    - Freelance jobs also are not very applicable to entry level applicants<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Trying to categorize by `sector` proved to be too inaccurate from the nature of the descriptions in the job posts\n",
    "    - Being able to <i>accurately</i> categorize by sector would add value, but would take too much time for this scope<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dataset had very little job positions for engineer/scientists due to the original search term being \"Data Analyst\"\n",
    "    - Scraping for all 3 search terms would add insight for the under-represented categories<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- `location` in the dataset was primarily from one geographic area and did not include positions from the entire U.S.\n",
    "    - Although the search was for the entire United States, it seems it was limited to a specific region\n",
    "    - If this was due to IP address, area could be more diversified by using a proxy<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- `date_posted` provided insights that certain fiscal quarters have increased hiring\n",
    "\n",
    "- We were able to distiguish skills for each `title` represented in the dataset\n",
    "    - this was validated by using a classification model to predict the `title`<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- `salary` was only present in 18% of the job postings. This represents a known issue for job searchers of no salary in the posting\n",
    "\n",
    "##### - Dashboard & Interactive Plots Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Presenting data with an interactive graph can allow for users to answer their own potential questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rather than having scrolls of graphs, it could also be summed up with an interactive graph\n",
    "\n",
    "##### - Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "**Validation:** \n",
    "- Set up a validation framework to periodically test the model on new job scrapings from Google and ensure its predictions remain accurate over time\n",
    "- If the model suddenly is inaccurate, this could represent a shift in the desired skills over time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Continuously add data for continued data insights**\n",
    "- Expand to the entire United States, rather than the limited geographic region\n",
    "- Continue scraping posts, to potentially identify upward and downward trends in certain skills desirability\n"
